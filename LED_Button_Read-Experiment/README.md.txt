# **LED Button Experiment**

This experiment was done to figure out the details of getting the Arduino to realize when the button is pressed down

### Components
Arduino Uno - The core component which connects all the devices together and runs the code
Resistor - A component which ensures that the electrical current doesn't overload the circuit and break the LED
LED - A simple LED light which lights up when provided power
Push Button - A simple button which completes a circuit when pressed
