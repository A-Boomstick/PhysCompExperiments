# **LED Strip Game Experiment**

This experiment was done to create a smaller scale prototype of the final game, testing the LED Strip as well as the functionality of the project concept

### Components
Arduino Uno - The core component, this connects all the hardware together and allows the code to be run
Adafruit Neopixel LED Strip - An LED strip with configurable colours, it has a library which allows for controlling and instructing it
Push Button - a simple button which completes a circuit when pressed
Potentiometer - A rotating resistor that can have its rotation angle measured for use in projects
